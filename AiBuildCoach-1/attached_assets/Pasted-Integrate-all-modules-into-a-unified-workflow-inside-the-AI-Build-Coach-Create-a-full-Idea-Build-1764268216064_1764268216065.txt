Integrate all modules into a unified workflow inside the AI Build Coach. Create a full “Idea → Build → Test → Improve → Publish” system that matches the workflow described below.

-----------------------------------------
WORKFLOW TO IMPLEMENT
-----------------------------------------

PHASE 1 — IDEA → BLUEPRINT
Use the existing **Build Planner** module to produce:
- app summary
- pages
- functions
- endpoints
- database
- user flow
- priority levels (A/B/C)
- cheap build prompts

Output JSON continues as before.

PHASE 2 — BLUEPRINT → STEP-BY-STEP BUILDING
Add a new global module called **Guided Build Workflow**.

This module must:
1. Convert the Build Planner output into a checklist of tasks.
2. Group tasks by priority:
   - Level A (core first)
   - Level B (improvements)
   - Level C (optional)
3. Each task MUST have a “Generate Build Prompt” button.
4. When clicked, generate a small, low-cost Replit prompt:
   - Only 1–2 files allowed to change
   - Short, simple, minimal
   - Friendly for a 12-year-old
   - Format:
        Goal:
        Files allowed to change:
        Keep everything else unchanged:
        Smallest edit possible:

5. Add a “Next Task” button.
6. Add a progress tracker (X/Y done).
7. Add a button “Fix My Error (Generate Fix Prompt)”:
   - User pastes error message
   - System returns a minimal Replit prompt containing the fix

Add a new endpoint: **/workflow**
Input: { idea }
Output:
{
  steps: [...],
  prompts: {...},
  next_step: "",
  error_fixer: false
}

PHASE 3 — TEST & IMPROVE (Existing Modules)
Integrate all existing modules into the new workflow:
- Overview
- Auto-Test
- UX Review
- SEO Check
- Competitor Insights

Rules:
- These modules must ONLY activate after Level A tasks are completed.
- This prevents cost waste.
- Add a banner: “Basic build not done yet — finish core tasks first.”

PHASE 4 — FINAL POLISH
After steps complete:
- Allow the user to run UX, SEO, Auto-Test, Competitor AI *in sequence*.
- Output short, simple improvements.
- For each improvement, generate a “Fix Prompt” just like above.

-----------------------------------------
UI CHANGES
-----------------------------------------

Add a new main tab: **Build Flow**.

Inside Build Flow:
- Show checklist with collapsible sections (A, B, C)
- Show step details
- Show “Generate Prompt” buttons
- Add “Copy Prompt” button
- Add “Fix My Error” button
- Add progress bar
- Add “Next Step” button

Add connection so that:
- Build Planner feeds into Build Flow
- Build Flow updates as tasks are completed
- Other modules become available after progress threshold (≈70%)

-----------------------------------------
LOW-COST MODE (MUST IMPLEMENT)
-----------------------------------------

All AI calls must:
- Use short prompts internally
- Limit output length
- Avoid long explanations
- Never rewrite entire files
- Never perform unnecessary refactors
- Only produce step-based, minimal changes

-----------------------------------------
GOAL
-----------------------------------------

Make the building experience identical to how the user worked with ChatGPT:
- Clear steps
- Guided prompts
- Small edits
- Easy to follow
- Minimal cost
- Smooth flow
- Beginner-friendly (12-year-old mode)

Integrate all modules into one consistent workflow, with Build Planner → Guided Workflow → Testing → Improvements → Publish sequence.
