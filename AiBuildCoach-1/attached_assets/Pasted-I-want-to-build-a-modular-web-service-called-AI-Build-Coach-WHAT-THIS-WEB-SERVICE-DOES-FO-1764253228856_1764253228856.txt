I want to build a modular web service called **AI Build Coach**.

### WHAT THIS WEB SERVICE DOES (FOR CONTEXT ONLY)
Users can paste any website URL into the app.  
The AI Build Coach will eventually provide:
1. **Functionality testing** – check if the website works (buttons, links, forms, flows).
2. **Auto-browsing** – automatically explore the site to find errors or broken interactions.
3. **UX & design review** – after everything works, suggest layout, spacing, readability and mobile improvements.
4. **SEO review** – analyse title, meta description, headings, content structure and accessibility.
5. **Competitor comparison** – compare the user’s website to other similar services and suggest missing features.
6. **Fix instructions** – generate very simple step-by-step tasks and copy-paste prompts the user can give to Replit to fix issues.
7. **Task modules** – group feedback into modules with checkboxes so users can track progress.

Users will access this tool through a simple webpage:
- They paste a URL
- Click “Analyse”
- Get structured modules with tasks and fix prompts

### IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
Do NOT build the real logic yet.  
Only build the **full project structure** and empty placeholders so we can fill each module step by step.

### BUILD THIS STRUCTURE:

#### 1. main.py (FastAPI backend)
- Enable CORS so frontend can access backend.
- Add a root GET endpoint ("/") that returns {"status": "AI Build Coach Online"}.
- Add placeholder POST routes:
    - /analyse
    - /auto-test
    - /seo-check
    - /competitors
- Each route should return {"message": "not implemented yet"}.
- Add comments explaining what each route will eventually do.
- Add a placeholder helper for fetching external URLs (important for later).

#### 2. Create a folder: modules  
Inside it create these files, each containing empty function stubs and clear docstrings describing their purpose:

- analyse_html.py  
  """Will later download external HTML, analyse structure, and produce basic issues."""

- auto_test.py  
  """Will later auto-browse a site, click buttons, detect errors, broken links, and console logs."""

- ui_review.py  
  """Will later analyse UX, layout, spacing, readability, and mobile view."""

- seo.py  
  """Will later analyse title, meta tags, headings, content and accessibility."""

- competitor.py  
  """Will later fetch competitor websites and compare features."""

- generate_prompts.py  
  """Will later generate simple copy-paste prompts to fix issues in Replit."""

- task_manager.py  
  """Will later organise tasks into modules, track status, and manage checklists."""

Each file should only contain minimal skeleton functions + comments.

#### 3. Create a folder: frontend
Add these files:

- index.html  
  - Input box for the website URL  
  - A button “Analyse Website”  
  - A result container  
  - Very simple, clean HTML (no advanced CSS yet)

- script.js  
  - When user clicks the button, send the URL to backend /analyse  
  - Display the JSON stub response in the result container  
  - Only basic code for now

- style.css  
  - Simple layout styling: centered content, readable spacing  
  - Nothing advanced yet

### FINAL INSTRUCTION
Only build the file/folder structure and clear placeholders.  
Do NOT implement real logic, AI analysis, auto-testing, UX checks, SEO checks, or competitor functions yet.
Keep everything clean and easy to extend later.
