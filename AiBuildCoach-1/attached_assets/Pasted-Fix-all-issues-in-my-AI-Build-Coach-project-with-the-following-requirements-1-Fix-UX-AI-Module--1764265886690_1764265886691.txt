Fix all issues in my AI Build Coach project with the following requirements:

1. **Fix UX AI Module**
   - The “summary” field currently shows `[object Object]`. Change it so the backend returns:
       { summary: string, tasks: [ { title, description, difficulty, element } ] }
   - Frontend must display the summary as normal text.
   - Show every UX improvement task with a SHORT description (max 1 sentence).
   - Tasks MUST be simple enough for a 12-year-old to understand.
   - Remove any empty UI blocks.
   - Remove “element” boxes if element is empty.

2. **Fix Auto-Test Module**
   - The current auto-test returns “Unknown error.”
   - Replace the auto-test with a very simple, lightweight test:
        • Load the URL with fetch()
        • Measure response time
        • Check if HTML contains <title>, <meta>, <h1>, <a>
        • Produce a short result: “Working”, “Slow”, or “Missing important tags”
   - This avoids using a browser automation library and stops errors/timeouts.
   - Make the auto-test fast (< 3 seconds).

3. **Fix Competitor AI Module**
   - Instead of long essays, reduce output by 90%.
   - Final competitor report format should be:
        - 3 strengths (short)
        - 3 weaknesses (short)
        - 3 things to improve immediately (short)
   - Only analyse 2 competitors maximum to reduce cost.
   - Make everything readable by a 12-year-old.

4. **Improve AI Output Cost**
   - Reduce token usage in ALL modules by:
        • Using short prompts internally
        • Returning only essential fields (summary, tasks, short lists)
        • Eliminating long explanations

5. **Improve Developer Usage**
   - Every task should automatically generate a “Fix Prompt” button:
        • When clicked, show a ready-to-copy prompt saying:
          “Fix this issue: [ISSUE]. Here is the HTML/CSS/JS snippet to update: [CODE]. Write updated code.”
   - The agent **should NOT fix the code itself**, only generate the prompt.

6. **General Rules**
   - Everything must be extremely simple and clear.
   - No long paragraphs.
   - No technical language that a beginner wouldn’t understand.
   - All modules must return stable JSON, no objects printed as "[object Object]".
   - After changes, run a self-test to ensure all endpoints return valid data.

Make these updates across the backend and frontend now.
